None of the toolchains produced the output I was after.</para></section><section><title>Why use XML for documentation ?</title><para>I prefer to write documentation for man pages in Docbook using the XMLMind XXE editor. It has Docbook templates and formatting features that allow for quick and easy creation of man pacges, articles etc. Additionally the XXE editor shows formatting in realtime allowing for a more complete sense of what the document will look like when finished.</para><para>However I could not find toolsets which gave satisfactory results when converting Docbook to Markdown or POD. This module provides a facility to perform those conversions.</para></section><section><title>Why not write an XLS stylesheet and use XSLT ?</title><para>After trying to get my head around the syntax of XSL stylesheets - and failing miserably to produce any decent output using them - I resorted to the "if all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail" approach and do it with a Perl module - which suited my competencies far better than XSL. </para></section><section><title>Installation</title><para>The latest code will always be on GitHub.
