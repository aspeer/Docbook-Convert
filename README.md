# ExtUtilqqs::Git 3 #

## NAME ##

ExtUtils::Git - ExtUtils::MakeMaker helper module to add git related Makefile
 targets

## SYNOPSIS ##

`perl -MExtUtils::Git Makefile.PL`

## Description ##

ExtUtils::Git is a ExtUtils::MakeMaker helper module that will add
 git related targets to the Makefile generated by a Makefile.PL run. It is
 intended to help during module development by enforcing some sanity checks
 around git related operations as they apply to Perl modules and provide
 other (sometime not git related) Makefile targets to improve
 productivity.

This module will undertake workflow check such as ensuring that all
 files in a Module MANIFEST file are present in git during checkin. It will
 increment version numbers and tag files during distribution builds and
 provide other utility functions.

## Options ##

Once the Makefile is built as per the synopsis the following git
 related and utility targets are available:

+ `git_init`

    Creates an empty git *repository* and
 **creates** a .gitignore file (using
 the git_ignore target). No files are added to the git
 repository

    This is an additional paragraph

+ `git_autocopyright`

    Will update copyright information (including updating
 copyright effective year) in all modules if found. If not found a
 copyright notice will be inserted at the top of the file derived
 from the LICENSE field in the Makefile.PL

+ `git_autolicense`

    Will update or create an appropriate LICENSE file in the
 module MANIFEST and working directory with text obtained from the
 `Software::License` Perl module

+ `git_ci`

    Check all changes into git repository for files found in the
 MANIFEST. Will run a sanity to check that only files in the MANIFEST
 are in the git repository and vica-versa

+ `git_push`

    Push all changes into remote repositories.

+ `git_release`

    Increment module version numbers, tag files and create a new
 distribution file for this module.

+ `git_status`

    Report status of git managed files vs MANIFEST and status of
 files (clean, changed, conflict)

+ `git_version_increment`

    Increment module version numbers

+ `cw`

    Run perl -c -w against all files in the module

+ `doc`

    Search for any DocBook or Markdown files in the directory
 structure and convert to POD. Files marked in the format
 module.pm.xml or module.pm.md will have their content converted to
 POD and appended to module.pm. Similarly for files in any bin
 directory.

+ `kwalitee`

    Run Module::CPANTS::Kwalitee tests against a distribution and
 report results

+ `perlcritic`

    Run perlcritic across all Perl files in the distribution
 MANIFEST and report results

+ `perltidy`

    Run perltidy across all Perl files in the distribution
 MANIFEST

+ `perlver`

    Run Perl::MinimumVersion across all Perl file in the
 distribution MANIFEST and report results

+ `readme`

    Generate README file

+ `subsort`

    Sort all subroutines in all Perl files in the distribution
 MANIFEST into alphabetical order
